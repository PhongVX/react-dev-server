This is just a demo of webpack-dev-server with a minimal React component.

It didn't work as expected in my initial development environment (Windows 10 running Node and NPM on Bash on Ubuntu on Windows), which I thought might be due to the hybrid environment breaking the file watching routines of webpack-dev-server. When I made changes to react/App.js there was no automatic refreshing, and the changes would only be reflected if I restarted webpack-dev-server. 

I am going to try it on MacOS Sierra and Ubuntu 16.10 before making additional modifications to the configuration.
